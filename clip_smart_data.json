This beginner-friendly program will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications.\n\nThis 3-course Specialization is an updated and expanded version of Andrew Ng\u2019s pioneering Machine Learning course. It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)",

It consists of two modules: a denoiser, which separates speech from a noisy audio, and an enhancer, which further boosts the perceptual audio quality by restoring audio distortions and extending the audio bandwidth. The two models are trained on high-quality 44.1kHz speech data that guarantees the enhancement of your speech with high quality.",

While neither of those modules is covered directly in this guide, many of the core concepts in argparse first originated in optparse, so some aspects of this tutorial will also be relevant to optparse users.
