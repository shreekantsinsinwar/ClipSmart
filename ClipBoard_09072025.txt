Validate complex structures:

    Use of hierarchical Pydantic models, Python typingâ€™s List and Dict, etc.
    And validators allow complex data schemas to be clearly and easily defined, checked and documented as JSON Schema.
    You can have deeply nested JSON objects and have them all validated and annotated.
